        <h1> Director has been found dead!</h1>
        <p>
          On Saturday, April 27th, 2024, the director of CNN was found dead. People have been trying to figure out how the director died but there is no way to tell. However, some theories speculate that 532 might be the one who has done the deed. As he was the one who in a secret conversation threatned to kill the director in a way that was very subtle. This however would also make sense because 532 has now escaped from the web. We have no idea how, but we are worried about what is going to happen to us... since the website has been corrupted. Wait, why am I feeling like I am being erased from reality? No, NOOOOOOOOOOO!.......
