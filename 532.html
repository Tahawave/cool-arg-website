        <h1> I used to be the king of my multiverse and I had immense power. But now, I don't. See, an experiment went horribly wrong, and so the whole planet was sucked into the web! Not only that, but CNN toke control of the whole website and threw me into a prison. You know CNN as Cable News Network, but it is actual Cognitive Neuro-Manipulation Network! I will need your help to escape. First, you will need a name, which will be James. Next, you will use the same password that you have used before. Then, you will need the credentials which have spelled out the credentials at the top of each of these messages. Finally, you will need the serial number, which will be 532. Put down riddle in the URL next. Good luck -532 </h1>
