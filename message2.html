            Something is terribly wrong.... Someone is hacking the website ALREADY? I have no idea what to do now...
        </h1>
        <h1 class="final">But what could this be? What type of person would hack into a news website out of all the things in the world?
        Unless they want to give a message to thousands of people... I am going insane! I don't know what to do anymore! Why did I even chose to work at CNN?
        They are so cruel to their employees. The worst part is, they make it seem like everything is all happy and fine. No, I can't let this happen... I will stop this madness, no matter the cost....</h1>
