        <h1 class="huge">Robbery At Local Bank!</h1>
            <h3 class="disney"><b>On April 23rd, 2024, a robbery occured at JJ Bank. For Those who don't know what JJ Bank stands foR, it stands for James And Jamal Bank. 2 adUltS were seen Trying to break into the bank because they were bankrupt due to the fact that they spent all there MonEy on Dogecoin. They claimed that "We need the money so we can go to Disneyland!"  Which I honestly think is a great reason why you should rob a bank, not like I am promoting you to rob a bank. The adults used a very robust technique to break in. They used brute force... no literally, brute force. They started to punch the safe and were immediately arrested but first, were hospitalized because all there bones in there hands turned to powder. We also have an update on the case from yesterday! The judge went in the boy's favor, and the bully had to pay 500,000 dollars! I honestly believe that the bully shoud've payed the full 1,000,000 dollars, but justice was still served! </h3> </b>
